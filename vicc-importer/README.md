# VICC-Importer

VICC is the [Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium](https://cancervariants.org). 
One of the aims of this consortium is to create a harmonized meta-knowledgebase from various actual knowledgebases (see [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-020-0603-8)).

This module imports the data that has been generated as part of this paper, and in addition does the following:
 *  For each feature, determines the event type as defined by the [SERVE](../algo/README.md) datamodel.
 *  Provides classification mapping to map all VICC entries onto [SERVE](../algo/README.md) actionable events.
 *  Loads up the database into a MySQL database
 
## Loading the VICC database into a MySQL database

 * Create the database using create_vicc_database.sql script from the VICC importer resources.
