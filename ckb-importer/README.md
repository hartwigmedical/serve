# CKB-Importer

[CKB](https://ckbhome.jax.org) - **C**linical **K**nowledge**b**ase - is a cancer knowledgebase provided by Jackson Lab. 
 
 This module imports the data that is provided in json format (CKB FLEX), and in addition does the following:
  *  For each molecular profile, determines the event type as defined by the [SERVE](../algo/README.md) datamodel.
  *  Provides classification mapping to map all molecular profiles onto [SERVE](../algo/README.md) actionable events.
  *  Loads up the database into a MySQL database
  
 ## Loading the CKB FLEX database into a MySQL database
 
 In order to load the CKB FLEX database into a MySQL database, one needs to:
  * Create the database using generate_ckb_db.sql script from the ckb-importer resources.
